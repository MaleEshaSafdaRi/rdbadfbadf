<h2>UI/UX Developer Interview Test</h2>

<h3>Quick Guide</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You will receive access on a repository to be used exclusively by you.</li>
  <li>You will be able to clone the repository and push new commits for 2 weeks. The exact expiration date will be
    confirmed when the repository URL will be provided.
  </li>
  <li>The repository contains all the material required for the test, including an existing project with some minimal
    functionality.
  </li>
  <li>You must install additional software on your local machine (see next section below).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Project Setup</h4>
<ol>
  <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Download</a> and install Git on the local machine.</li>
  <li>Clone the interview test repository locally.
    <ul>
      <li>Open a terminal window in the directory where you want to clone the repository.</li>
      <li>Run command <code>git clone `url`</code> (the URL will be provided)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/v14.17.0/">Download</a> and install NodeJS 14.17 on the local machine. If you
    already have another version installed, you may try to run the project without changing it to 14.17.0 but please
    consider that the existing project has only been tested with this version.
  </li>
  <li>In the cloned repository directory run the following commands in a terminal window.
    <ul>
      <li><code>npm install</code> to install npm package dependencies.</li>
      <li><code>npm run start</code> to start the application.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to <a href="http://localhost:4200">http://localhost:4200</a> in the browser. The application should be up
    and running.
  </li>
  <li>To stop the application press <code>Ctrl + C</code> in the terminal window and follow confirmation instructions.
  </li>
</ol>

Worthy Notes:
<ul>
  <li>The existing project was generated with Angular CLI version 13.2.3.</li>
  <li>Modifying existing files would trigger a live reload of the application.</li>
  <li>Adding or removing files could require a restart by stopping the application and running `npm run start` again.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Commit & Push Changes</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Open a terminal window in the cloned repository directory.</li>
  <li>Run <code>git add -A</code></li>
  <li>Run <code>git commit -am '[comment]'</code></li>
  <li>Run <code>git push</code></li>
</ol>

<h3>2. Tasks</h3>
<ol class="test-tasks">
  <li>Update the UI for the existing functionality on the Angular CLI project. Style, clean and refactor as needed.
    Allow the user to switch between two themes (light/dark). The application can be modified in any way possible if the
    following requirements are still fulfilled:
    <ul class="functional-requirements">
      <li>Organization
        <ul>
          <li>Must be able to select an organization.</li>
          <li>Must be able to change the selected organization.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Departments
        <ul>
          <li>Must be able to view a list of existing departments inside the selected organization.</li>
          <li>Must be able to search departments by name in the list of existing departments.</li>
          <li>Must be able to view department details.</li>
          <li>Must be able to edit department details.</li>
          <li>Must include, as department details, a name, a manager, an annual budget and a list of employees.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Employees
        <ul>
          <li>Must be able to see the list of existing employees inside the selected organization.</li>
          <li>Must be able to search employees by name in the list of existing employees.</li>
          <li>Must be able to view employee details.</li>
          <li>Must include, as employee details, the first name, the last name, the hired date, the age and the salary.
          </li>
          <li>Could include, as employee details an image of the employee.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create story boards, mocks or other assets that help illustrate the UI/UX with the functionality to be added:
    <ul class="functional-requirements">
      <li>Must be able to add a new organization.</li>
      <li>Must always have a name entered for newly added organizations.</li>
      <li>Must be able to add a new department.</li>
      <li>Must be able to add a new employee.</li>
      <li>Must allow to the possibility to create a new organization along with its departments and their employees in
        one action instead of creating one level at a time. This could be associated with a wizard like control.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Implement the functional UI/UX prototype for the functionality that allows the user to create a new organization
    with departments and employees in one action.
  </li>
  <li>Provide design feedback for several screenshots of complex functionality that is briefly described. Consider what
    is done well and what can be improved. Check next section for details.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>3. UI/UX Feedback Resources</h3>
Each screenshot is given a context and two descriptions. The descriptions are hidden by default so that will not
influence you in this process from the beginning. Please write any feedback in the files located in
<i>[repository]/task_4/</i> directory.
<ol>
  <li><b>EMCIP - Map Feature</b><br/>

          the users to show recorded incidents on the map, filter them and apply various map features. The filtering of
          the incidents can be done using logical conditions and are displayed on the left panel. These conditions can
          be saved, named, tagged, shared and reused. The screenshot contains 3 areas that are displayed on the map and
          help filtering the occurrences to the area inside them. On the right side of the screenshot there are the map
          features options and the legends associated with them. The traffic density feature also contains some region
          and time options also displayed on the rights side.</p>

        <a id="02-bd-hide" onclick="hide('02-bd')" style="display: none">[hide]</a>
        <p class="description" id="02-bd" style="display: none">The screenshot represents the template feature which

        <p class="description" id="02-dd" style="display: none">The screenshot represents the template feature which
          allows the users to generate draft schedules based multiple constraints configurations
          for analyzing different scenarios, KPIs and outcomes.Each shift can have multiple events such as Leaves,
          Duties or Suspensions, Preferred working days and the actual shift. Shifts can be of multiple type with
          different starting hours (morning, afternoon, night). At the bottom of the page it is displayed the status of
          the required resources compared with the actual allocated resources, grouped by qualification and then by
          shift type. At the top of the shift's table there are three scores (hard, unassigned shifts, soft) which
          represent the total score of the solution. Employees are assigned based on the team's shift in the respective
          day (Approach Control Unit 3 in the picture). The upper-right side contain multiple selects with different
          actions for modifying the requirements, the shifts, the constraints or the settings of the template (period,
          resources).
